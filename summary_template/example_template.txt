Group the column names based on semntic similarity - there are k of such groups. 4. Give each group a title. 5. Create a dictionary where each key is a group title and the values are the associated column names. 6. Find a general description that contains the group title and information that you can extract from the 'dataframe title'.
Rules: 1. Return the dictionary and the general discription. 2. Create only 1 sentences for the general discription. 3. Do NOT add any explanation to you answer.
